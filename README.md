# Java ArithmeticException: Division by Zero

This repository demonstrates a common runtime exception in Java: `ArithmeticException`.  The `Bug.java` file contains code that attempts to divide by zero. This results in an `ArithmeticException` being thrown at runtime.  The `BugSolution.java` file shows how to handle this exception using a `try-catch` block, preventing the program from crashing.
